## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Fork and Clone repo

Fork the repo to your Github account, then run the following command to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT]/morphic.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd morphic
bun install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in the required environment variables in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Required for Core Functionality
OPENAI_API_KEY=     # Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
TAVILY_API_KEY=     # Get from https://app.tavily.com/home
```

For optional features configuration (Redis, SearXNG, etc.), see [CONFIGURATION.md](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

### 4. Run app locally

#### Using Bun

```bash
bun dev
```

#### Using Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## 🌐 Deploy

Host your own live version of Morphic with Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or Docker.

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmiurla%2Fmorphic&env=OPENAI_API_KEY,TAVILY_API_KEY,UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN)

### Docker Prebuilt Image

Prebuilt Docker images are available on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/miurla/morphic:latest
```

You can use it with docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
  morphic:
    image: ghcr.io/miurla/morphic:latest
    env_file: .env.local
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - ./models.json:/app/public/config/models.json # Optional: Override default model configuration
```

The default model configuration is located at `public/config/models.json`. For Docker deployment, you can create `models.json` alongside `.env.local` to override the default configuration.

## 🔎 Search Engine

### Setting up the Search Engine in Your Browser

If you want to use Morphic as a search engine in your browser, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser settings.
2. Navigate to the search engine settings section.
3. Select "Manage search engines and site search".
4. Under "Site search", click on "Add".
5. Fill in the fields as follows:
   - **Search engine**: Morphic
   - **Shortcut**: morphic
   - **URL with %s in place of query**: `https://morphic.sh/search?q=%s`
6. Click "Add" to save the new search engine.
7. Find "Morphic" in the list of site search, click on the three dots next to it, and select "Make default".

This will allow you to use Morphic as your default search engine in the browser.
