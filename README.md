### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmiurla%2Fmorphic&env=OPENAI_API_KEY,TAVILY_API_KEY,UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN)

### Docker Prebuilt Image

Prebuilt Docker images are available on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/miurla/morphic:latest
```

You can use it with docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
  morphic:
    image: ghcr.io/miurla/morphic:latest
    env_file: .env.local
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - ./models.json:/app/public/config/models.json # Optional: Override default model configuration
```

The default model configuration is located at `public/config/models.json`. For Docker deployment, you can create `models.json` alongside `.env.local` to override the default configuration.
