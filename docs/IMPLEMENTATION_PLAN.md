## üìù Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Leverage Existing Morphic Framework**: Build upon existing artifact system and tool architecture
- **Modular Design**: Keep educational features as extensions rather than replacements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Maintain backward compatibility with search functionality
- **Performance First**: Prioritize responsive code editing and execution

### Technical Considerations
- **Security**: Sandboxed code execution is critical for user safety
- **Accessibility**: Ensure educational interface works with screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Mobile Support**: Educational features must work well on tablets and mobile devices
- **Offline Capability**: Consider offline mode for downloaded lessons

### Content Strategy
- **Curriculum Development**: Focus on practical, hands-on programming education
- **Multi-language Support**: Start with JavaScript, expand to Python, HTML/CSS
- **Difficulty Progression**: Clear learning paths from beginner to advanced
- **Real-world Projects**: Include practical, portfolio-worthy exercises
