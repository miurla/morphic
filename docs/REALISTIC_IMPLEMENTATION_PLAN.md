# Realistic Educational Platform Implementation Plan

## üö® **Current Reality Check (July 7, 2025)**

### **What's Actually Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Basic educational schemas and types
- ‚úÖ Educational agent framework (tools integration)
- ‚úÖ Basic lesson state management
- ‚úÖ One mock educational UI component
- ‚úÖ One sample lesson (JavaScript variables)

### **What's Missing (Critical Gaps):**
- ‚ùå **No lesson content system** (creation, management, storage)
- ‚ùå **No narration/speech system** (text-to-speech, voice controls)
- ‚ùå **No interactive challenges** (code validation, exercises)
- ‚ùå **No lesson browser/catalog** (lesson selection, search)
- ‚ùå **No integration with main app** (educational mode access)
- ‚ùå **No real lesson content** (only 1 mock lesson exists)
