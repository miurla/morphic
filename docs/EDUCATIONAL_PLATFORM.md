## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Educational Agent Integration

The educational instructor is integrated into the existing AI agent system:

```typescript
// Enhanced with educational capabilities
export function educationalInstructor({
  messages,
  model,
  lessonMode = true
}: {
  messages: CoreMessage[]
  model: string
  lessonMode?: boolean
}): EducationalInstructorReturn {
  return {
    model: getModel(model),
    system: EDUCATIONAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    messages,
    tools: {
      code_editor: createCodeEditorTool(model),
      highlight: createHighlightTool(model),
      step_navigation: createStepNavigationTool(model),
      ocr: createOCRTool(model),
      progress: progressTracker
    },
    experimental_activeTools: lessonMode ? 
      ['code_editor', 'highlight', 'step_navigation', 'ocr', 'progress'] : [],
    maxSteps: lessonMode ? 10 : 1
  }
}
```

### State Management

The lesson state manager handles complex lesson flows:

```typescript
export class LessonStateManager {
  async initialize(): Promise<LessonState>
  async updateState(stepId: number, isCorrect: boolean): Promise<LessonState>
  async navigateToStep(stepId: number): Promise<LessonState>
  async getCurrentState(): Promise<LessonState>
  async resetProgress(): Promise<LessonState>
}
```

### Code Execution Service

Safe code execution with security controls:

```typescript
export class CodeExecutionService {
  async execute(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<ExecutionResult>
  private async executeJavaScript(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<ExecutionResult>
  private async executePython(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<ExecutionResult>
  private async executeHTML(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<ExecutionResult>
